      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alyssa Alvarez, and I am a graduate student attending Arizona State University in hopes of earning a Master's degree in economics.</p>
      <p>I have a strong passion for both economics and environmental sustainability where I aspire to work in a field that allows me to make a positive impact through economic research and policy analysis. For my undergraduate studies, I atteneded Northern Arizona University where I received a Bachelor's in Business Economics and developed a solid foundation in economic theory and quantitative analysis. I hope to broaden my current knowledge at Arizona State University and learn more about econometrics and data analysis to further my career in economic research.
